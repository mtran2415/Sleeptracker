# Sleeptracker

This is a sleep tracker mobile app that I created for a course in User Interaction Software at UCI. A user can log their overnight sleep, log their sleepiness according to the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (https://web.stanford.edu/~dement/sss.html), and view all of their logs. The project utilizes the Ionic framework. Also, the project stores the user's logs on a Firebase database.
